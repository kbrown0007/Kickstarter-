 # Kickstarting with Excel
 There are different campaigns that  fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. I will be graphing the outcomes
## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this is to sort campaign outcomes so that we can see the outcomes of the launch dates from January to December.  this will hellp us to see As well as 
seeing the outcomes for the success failed campaigns and even those that got cancelled.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
My analysis is that the campaign in the year has some success overall, yet it seems to me that it also has fallen short of it predicted goals.  
During the month of May and June is where we seen the most success. .  It really started to decline in November and December seeing some of the lowest numbers. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

I found that trying to reduce some of the formats to the dataset to be a little troublesome. Like deadline dates were placed in seconds rather than months. Which can be almost imposable to know exactly what those numbers mean.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

A lot of the information is not in the right format for readable data. Some of the format have to be changed and adjusted to read the right numbers and changed into the right formats.  
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

We could make a table based on the launch date, But based on the years instead of the months. 
You could aslo make a table showing the outcomes of the gaols. You could aslo make a table showing the outcomes of the gaols.
